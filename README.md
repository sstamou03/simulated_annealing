# Unruly Solver with Simulated Annealing

This project solves the **Unruly** puzzle using the **Simulated Annealing** algorithm. It was developed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course at the **Technical University of Crete (TUC)** under the guidance of Professor **M. Lagoudakis**. The project leverages foundational code from the [AIMA Python repository](https://github.com/aimacode/aima-python).

You can play the Unruly game online [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/unruly.html).

## **Game Description**

The objective of the **Unruly** puzzle is to fill an \(n \times m\) board with black and white tiles, following these constraints:

1. No more than two consecutive tiles of the same color in any row or column.
2. Each row and column must have an equal number of black and white tiles.
